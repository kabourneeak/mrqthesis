\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{:conclusion}

In this final chapter, we summarize the contributions from the previous chapters as well as possible directions for future research.

\section{Summary of Contributions}
\label{:conclusion:contributions}

This thesis presents several contributions in the area of majority range searching.

\paragraph{Query Rectangles with Segments.} We consider querying axis-parallel lines segments against query rectangles.



\section{Future Work}
\label{:conclusion:open-problems}

In this section, we summarize the future work we have discussed in previous chapters.

\begin{enumerate}
\item From Chapter~\ref{:rectangles}, can we remove the restriction that $1/2 < \rho$ when querying on arbitrarily oriented line segments?

\item From Chapter~\ref{:monotonep}, can we extend our multi-region formulas to work with simple polygons?

\end{enumerate}
