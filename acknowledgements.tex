\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

%There are a great many people I would like to thank for helping me achieve success here at Carleton.

%My supervisors, Anil Maheshwari and Michiel Smid, have had theirs doors open to me for my entire tenure at Carleton, ever since my first summer in the Computational Geometry lab way back in the beginning of my undergraduate degree. 
%They have endured countless drop-in questions, and provided just as many back of the napkin examples any time I needed help navigating a problem.

%The Computational Geometry lab has been an amazing environment to work and learn in. 
%The entire faculty of the CG lab, Prosenjit Bose, Anil Maheshwari, Pat Morin, and Michiel Smid, put in countless hours supporting each and every student in the lab. 
%I would like to thank Jean-Lou De Carufel for teaching me the art of inequalities. 
%My fellow students in the lab have always been up for an impromptu whiteboard session, and I would like to thank Nima Hoda and Simon Pratt especially teaching me as much about our coursework as the lectures did.

%I would also like to thank Prof. Subhas Nandy of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, who got me started with this thesis work. 
%Thank you for your hospitality in India, and for all the chai.

%I gratefully acknowledge Carleton University, the School of Computer Science, and the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for their generous funding support.

%Finally, to my amazing wife, Kathryn Bint. I would never have survived my education without your love and unerring support in the face of an endless streak of busy evenings and weekends.
