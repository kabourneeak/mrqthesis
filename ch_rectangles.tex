\chapter{Majority Range Queries with Axis-Parallel Rectangles}
\label{:rectangles}

In this chapter, we begin with a simple environment for performing majority range queries. Even with this simplified model, we will be able to identify where the main challenges of this problem domain lie and construct some techniques which we will use to solve many of the more complex problems.

We will present two variations of the majority range search problem in this chapter. Both use axis-parallel rectangles as their query. Both variations will query over line segments, which are the simplest type of object which has a concept of majority. In the first variation, the line segments will also be axis-parallel, whereas in Section~\ref{:rectangles:ao}, we allow segments of arbitrary orientation.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Axis-Parallel Segments}
\label{:rectangles:ap}

In this section we consider axis-parallel line segments in the plane and queries in the form of axis-parallel rectangles.
This is the simplest 2D environment on which we can perform a majority range query as the objects and query region are both simple geometric objects, and we can rely on their fixed orientations while expressing equations about them. 
We will discuss only horizontal segments here.
The solution for vertical segments is identical, and we discuss how to combine the two approaches at the end of the section.

We define our first problem as follows.

\begin{problem}
Given a set $S$ of $n$ axis-parallel line segments in the plane, and a fixed parameter $\rho$ such that $0 < \rho \leq 1$, we want to return the number of segments from $S$ which are mostly enclosed by an axis-parallel query rectangle $Q$. A given segment $s \in S$ satisfies the majority property (i.e., is considered mostly enclosed by $Q$) if and only if $|s \cap Q| \geq \rho \cdot |s|$.
\end{problem}


\subsection{Definitions}
\label{:rectangles:ap:defs}

Each segment $s_i \in S, 1 \leq i \leq n$ is defined by its two endpoints $p_i = (a_i, b_i)$ and $q_i = (c_i, d_i)$. 
Without loss of generality, we will assume that $p_i$ is the leftmost endpoint of $s_i$ (or the lower endpoint if $s_i$ is vertical). 
We define $l_i = |s_i|$ as the length of $s_i$; for horizontal segments the length is easily calculated as $l_i = c_i - a_i$. 
Our query $Q$ is given by its lower-left corner $(\alpha, \beta)$ and its upper-right corner $(\gamma, \delta)$. 
$s_i \in_\rho Q$ if $s_i$ satisfies the majority property for $Q$, otherwise $s \not \in_\rho Q$.

For any $x$-coordinate, $\iline{x}$ is the vertical line through $x$. Similarly, for any $y$-coordinate, $\iline{y}$ is the horizontal line through $y$. For example, $\iline{\beta}$ is the horizontal line through the bottom boundary of $Q$, while $\iline{a_i}$ is the vertical line through $a_i$, and thus, through the left endpoint of $s_i$. Finally, we define $\iline{s_i}$ as the line through the segment $s_i$; for a horizontal segment $s_i$, the lines $\iline{s_i}$, $\iline{b_i}$, and $\iline{d_i}$ are all equivalent. When we focus on any single, general segment, we omit the $i$ subscripts for clarity.


\subsection{Decomposing the Problem}
\label{:rectangles:ap:approach}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=1.00\columnwidth]{figures/fig_oo_cases}
\caption[The different cases of axis-parallel segments.]{An axis-parallel query on axis-parallel segments. Different cases of horizontal segments interacting with the query region are shown.}
\label{:fig:rectangles:ap:cases}
\end{figure}

As Figure~\ref{:fig:rectangles:ap:cases} illustrates, there are several cases to consider regarding how a horizontal segment $s \in S$ may interact with $Q$. Cases $(1)$, $(2)$, and $(3)$, where $s$ is entirely left, entirely within, or entirely right of $Q$, respectively, are exactly an instance of  standard range searching problems where we look to find elements which are completely inside or completely outside of a query region.  

Case $(4)$ considers segments where $s$ crosses only the left boundary of $Q$. 
Looking at it another way, $s$ has its left endpoint left of $\alpha$, while its right endpoint $q$ satisfies $\alpha \leq q \leq \gamma$.  
We further subdivide case $(4)$ into cases where, for some appropriate value of $\rho$, $s \in_\rho Q$ in case $(4a)$ and $s \not \in_\rho Q$ in case $(4b)$.
Cases $(5a)$ and $(5b)$ are similar to cases $(4a)$ and $(4b)$, but with respect to $\gamma$. 
Specifically, $s$ falls into case $(5)$ when $\alpha \leq p \leq \gamma$ and $q > \gamma$. 

In case $(6)$, $s$ crosses both the left and right boundaries of $Q$, and, crucially, neither $p$ nor $q$ are inside $Q$. As like in cases $(4)$ and $(5)$, $s$ is in case $(6a)$ if $s \in_\rho Q$ and $(6b)$ if $s \not \in_\rho Q$.

Our goal is to identify and count all of the segments belonging to cases $(2)$, $(4a)$, $(5a)$, and $(6a)$, and none of the segments belonging to any other case.

Our approach to solving this problem involves restricting and classifying segments step-by-step until, for some subset of segments, we are able to identify an expression representing its majority property.  Our solution proceeds as follows.

\paragraph{Step 1.} As we are only considering horizontal segments for now, we only need to consider those segments which are neither above nor below $Q$, since they can never intersect $Q$ at all. Let $S_1 = \{ s \in S \st \beta \leq b \leq \delta\}$. 

\paragraph{Step 2.} Identify those segments which are not ``too long''.  Let $w = \gamma - \alpha$ be the width of $Q$.  Any segment $s$ having the property $|s| > \frac{w}{\rho}$ can never have its majority property satisfied, no matter how it intersects $Q$.  Let $S_2 = \{ s \in S_1 \st |s| \leq \frac{w}{\rho} \}$.

\paragraph{Step 3.} Partition the remaining segments according the location of their left endpoint with respect to $\alpha$.
Specifically, let $S_L = \{s \in S_2 \st a < \alpha \}$ and let $S_R = \{ s \in S_2 \st a \geq \alpha \}$.

\paragraph{Step 4.} Test the appropriate majority expression to determine if $s$ should be counted. For segments whose left endpoint is left of $\alpha$, we want to ensure that ``not too much of $s$ is outside of $Q$''; Let $S_L' = \{ s \in S_L \st \alpha - a < (1 - \rho) \cdot l\}$. For segments whose left endpoint is at or right of $\alpha$, we want to ensure that ``enough of $s$ is inside $Q$''; Let $S_R' = \{ s \in S_R \st \gamma - a \geq  \rho l \}$. Our claim is that the subset of segments satisfying the majority property is $S_\rho = S_L' \cup S_R'$. 

\begin{proof}
The correctness of Steps 1 and 2 are straight-forward, and Step 3 merely partitions the remaining segments. Thus, we focus on Step 4 and show that for each case, a segment belonging to that case is correctly accepted or rejected.

Consider the segments in $S_L$, which we check against the majority property expression $\alpha - a < (1 - \rho) \cdot l$. That is, we are looking at how much of $s$ is outside of $Q$. Segments in case $(1)$ have $\alpha - a > l$, so they are correctly rejected. Segments in cases $(4a)$ and $(4b)$ are accepted or rejected quite straight-forwardly by this condition; that is, if not too much of $s$ is outside $Q$, then ``enough'' of $s$ must be inside.  

The most interesting cases are $(6a)$ and $(6b)$, and they are the motivation behind Step 2.  After Step 2, we know that $|s| < \frac{w}{\rho}$, which implies that any segment in $s \in S_L$ that crosses both $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ must satisfy $s \in_\rho Q$, since $|s \cap Q|$ is exactly $w$, and $w$ is sufficient. This property allows us to avoid explicitly deciding if $s$ crosses $\gamma$, since if not too much of $s$ is outside $Q$, $s$ either crosses only $\alpha$ and case $(4)$ holds, or it crosses $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, and $w$ is sufficient.

Next, we consider the segments in $S_R$, which we check against the majority property expression $\gamma - a \geq  \rho l$ for $s \in S_R$. 
This expression checks the affirmative case, that is, that enough of $s$ is inside $Q$.
For case $(2)$, $\gamma - a \geq l$. 
Since $l \geq \rho l$ for all valid values of $\rho$, these segments are accepted.
On the other hand, for case $(3)$, $\gamma - a < 0$ and all such segments are rejected. 
In the final cases, $(5a)$ and $(5b)$, the value of $|s \cap Q|$ is measured directly, and the segments are classified appropriately.

\end{proof}


\subsection{Construction and Analysis}
\label{:rectangles:ap:analysis}

Each step of Section~\ref{:rectangles:ap:approach} includes or excludes segments by examining inequalities. Each inequality is made up of some of the input parameters of each segment and a single query variable. To perform the query, we will map each segment to a point in 4D where each component of the point is based on the segment input parameters corresponding to one of our inequalities, and map the query variables given by $Q$ to a 4D box. The query can then be answered using a multi-level range tree.

Recall that for every $s \in S$, we have $s = (a, b, l)$ as the $x$-coordinate of the left endpoint, $y$-coordinate of the left endpoint, and length of the segment, respectively.  The query region $Q$ has width $w = \gamma - \alpha$. Let $v$ be the 4D point we create which corresponds to $s$.

The first two conditions we need to check are the same for all cases. 
We first isolate segments based directly on their $y$-coordinate; thus, the first component of $v$ will be $b$, and the first component of our 4D query box will be $[\beta, \delta]$.
We next want to include only segments where $l \leq \frac{w}{\rho}$. We can rewrite this as $\rho l \leq w$. 
Thus, the second component of $v$ will be $\rho l$, and the second component of our query box will be $(0, w]$.

Our segments are next classified according to which side of $\alpha$ their left endpoints are found.
We set the third component of $v$ to $a$.
Our overall query will need to look at both cases and combine the results later. 
The third component of the query box will be either $(-\infty, \alpha)$ or $[\alpha, \infty)$ depending on which phase of the query is executing.

Finally, we need to check the majority expressions. We have two cases to check. The first expression is for segments whose left endpoint is left of $\alpha$. The majority expression $\alpha - a < (1 - \rho) \cdot l$ can be rewritten as $\alpha < a + (1-\rho) \cdot l$. Therefore, we set the fourth component of $v$ to $a + (1 - \rho) \cdot l$, and the fourth component of the query box to $(\alpha, \infty)$.  All together, to answer this case, every segment $s_i \in S$ is mapped to the 4D point 
\[ 
v_i = (b_i, \rho l_i, a_i, a_i + (1-\rho) \cdot l_i)
\]

\noindent and is queried by the 4D query box
\[
[\beta, \delta] \times (0, w] \times (-\infty, \alpha) \times (\alpha, \infty)
\]

The second expression is for segments whose left endpoint is at or right of $\alpha$. The majority expression $\gamma - a \geq \rho l$ can be rewritten as $\gamma \geq a + \rho l$. 
Therefore, we set the fourth component of $v$ to $a + \rho l$, and the fourth component of the query box to $(-\infty, \gamma]$.  
All together, to answer this case, every segment $s_i \in S$ is mapped to the point
\[
v_i' = (b_i, \rho l_i, a_i, a_i + \rho l_i)
\]

\noindent and is queried by the box
\[
[\beta, \delta] \times (0, w] \times [\alpha, \infty) \times (-\infty, \gamma]
\]

By Corollary~\ref{cor:rangetree}, we can answer either of these queries by constructing a multi-level range tree.
As our points are in 4D, such a tree would require $\BigOh{n \log^3{n}}$ time and space for preprocessing and could answer queries in $\BigOh{\log^3{n}}$ time.
To find all horizontal segments satisfying their majority property, we need to perform both queries and combine the results.  

A second data structure and query does not change the asymptotic requirements of the algorithm, however, we do note that since the mapped points for both data structures have the same three first components, we can save a constant factor of space by sharing the first three levels of the multi-level range tree. 
At the third level of the multi-level tree, we create \emph{two} associate structures, one for each of the majority expressions, and query each one as needed. 
In a similar way, we can save a constant factor of time during our queries, since both queries consider the same values for their first two components.


\paragraph{Vertical Segments.} The method for querying vertical segments is very similar to that for horizontal segments, except that we care about the height of $Q$ rather than its width, and need to consider symmetric coordinates of each segment when going through each of the 4 steps.
Preprocessing and querying this extra orientation of segments costs us a constant factor of time, since the number of orientations remains fixed.


\paragraph{Combining the Steps.} Combining the structures necessary for both the horizontal and vertical portions of the query completes our solution to our problem statement given at the beginning of this section, which is summarized by the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:ap}
Given a set of $n$ axis-parallel line segments, we can identify all segments which satisfy the majority property for a given query rectangle in $\BigOh{\log^3{n}}$ time, using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^3{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{theorem}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Arbitrarily-Oriented Segments}
\label{:rectangles:ao}

In this section, we relax the restriction that all segments should be axis-parallel, allowing each segment to have any arbitrary orientation with respect to one another. 
It does not matter if segments intersect. 
The problem statement is as follows.

\begin{problem}
Given a set $S$ of $n$ arbitrarily-oriented line segments in the plane, and a fixed parameter $\rho$ such that $1/2 < \rho \leq 1$, we want to return the number of segments from $S$ which are mostly enclosed by axis-parallel query rectangle $Q$. A given segment $s \in S$ satisfies the majority property (i.e., is considered mostly enclosed by $Q$) if and only if $|s \cap Q| \geq \rho \cdot |s|$.
\end{problem}

Throughout this section, the query region $Q$ and the segments in $S$ follow the same definitions as in Section~\ref{:rectangles:ap:defs}. Observe that the definition for $\rho$ is different than in Section~\ref{:rectangles:ap}; we discuss this difference in the conclusion of this chapter.


\subsection{Decomposing the Problem}
\label{:rectangles:ao:approach}

There are three principal cases to consider; those segments which have both endpoints inside $Q$, those with only one endpoint inside $Q$, and those with both endpoints outside $Q$.  

The first case, where both endpoints are inside $Q$, is answered by mapping each segment to a point in 4D space and then using a multi-level range tree, just as we did in the previous section.  Specifically, we map each segment $s_i$ to the point $v_i = (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i)$. The query $Q$ is mapped to the following 4D box
\[
[\alpha, \gamma] \times [\beta, \delta] \times [\alpha, \gamma] \times [\beta, \delta]
\]

In essence, we are just testing to ensure that both of the endpoints appear within the horizontal and vertical components of the query.

The second case, where only one endpoint is inside $Q$ is solved using the exact same method as the first case, but on a ``virtual'' segment.  For each segment $s_i$, we create virtual segments which share endpoints with $s_i$.  Specifically, we define the segment $s_{i,p} \subseteq s_i$ where $s_i$ and $s_{i,p}$ share the endpoint $p_i$ and $|s_{i,p}| = \rho \cdot |s_i|$. Likewise, we define the segment $s_{i,q} \subseteq s_i$ where $s_i$ and $s_{i,q}$ share the endpoint $q$ and $|s_{i,q}| = \rho \cdot |s_i|$.

Then, as a direct consequence of their construction, if $s_{i,p} \in Q$, then $s_i \in_\rho Q$, and if $s_{i,q} \in Q$, then $s_i \in_\rho Q$.  Counting both of these cases will double-count any segment which has both endpoints in $Q$, so we subtract any such segments to compensate.

We can query these higher dimensional points by applying the multi-level range tree method given by Corollary~\ref{cor:rangetree}.


\subsection{Handling Endpoints Outside of $Q$}
\label{:rectangles:ao:bothout}

Just as we saw in Section~\ref{:rectangles:ap:approach}, the case where both endpoints are outside of $Q$ will be the most challenging case to handle.

We begin by partitioning the space around $Q$ into 8 regions by extending lines through its horizontal and vertical boundaries. These regions are labelled anti-clockwise from left-middle as $I, II, \ldots, VIII$; see Figure~\ref{fig:rectangles:ao:regions}). Any segment which passes through $Q$ but which has neither endpoint in $Q$ will have its endpoints in two distinct regions. Not every pair of regions is legal, however. For example, a segment with one endpoint in region $I$ and another in region $II$ cannot intersect $Q$.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/fig_ao_regions}
  \caption{The 8 regions surrounding $Q$.}
  \label{fig:rectangles:ao:regions}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A segment which passes through $Q$ may involve any of the following pairs of regions, falling into 4 classes:

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item Parallel sides: $(I, V), (III, VII)$.
\item Perpendicular sides: $(I, III), (III, V), (V,VII), (VII, I)$.
\item Diagonal to Orthogonal: $(II, V)$, $(II, VII)$, $(IV, I)$, $(IV,VII)$, $(VI, I)$, $(VI, III)$, $(VIII, III)$, $(VIII, V)$.
\item Diagonal to Diagonal: $(II, VI), (IV, VIII)$.
\end{enumerate}

We will query for each case separately and combine our results at the end. For a segment $s \in S$, we can identify the regions of $p$ and $q$ using a 4-dimensional orthogonal range search. This classification allows us to determine which majority expressions we need to test in the second phase of the query. We develop expressions for deciding the majority property of each case below.

In all cases, we require the following additional definitions. Let $o_i = (e_i, f_i)$ be the centre point of $s_i$.  We define the function $d(u,v)$ as the Euclidean distance between any two points $u$ and $v$. We define $L_i = d(p_i, q_i)/2$ to be exactly half the length of $s_i$ (therefore, $d(p_i, o_i) = d(q_i, o_i) = L_i$). As with our previous definitions, when we discuss any single, general segment $s \in S$, we will drop the $i$ subscripts for clarity.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Class (i); e.g., $(p, q) \in (I, V)$}
\label{:rectangles:ao:class1}

Class (i) is concerned with segments which cross parallel sides of $Q$. We present the details of the majority property for the case where $p \in I$ and $q \in V$; the solution for the $(III, VII)$ case is similar.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/fig_ao_case1}
  \caption{An example of a segment in class (i), case $(I, V)$.}
  \label{fig:rectangles:ao:case1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Let $s \in S$ be a segment belonging to class (i), case $(I, V)$.
Assume for now that $o \in Q$ and let $p'$ ($q'$) be the intersection of $s$ with $Q$ closest to $p$ ($q$).  
Let $u = (a, f)$ be the point vertically aligned with $p$ and horizontally aligned with $o$. Then, $\Delta p u o$ is a right triangle, and $u' = (\alpha, f)$ is the intersection point of $\overline{u o}$ with the boundary of $Q$.  
The triangle $\Delta p' u' o$ is right triangle and is similar to $\Delta p u o$. 
Likewise, let $v = (c, f)$ be the point vertically aligned with $q$ and horizontally aligned with $o$. Then, $\Delta q v o$ is a right triangle, and $v' = (\gamma, f)$ is the intersection point of $\overline{v o}$ with the boundary of $Q$. The triangle $\Delta q' v' o$ is right triangle and is similar to $\Delta q v o$. See Figure~\ref{fig:rectangles:ao:case1}.

We will test the majority property by checking that ``not too much of $s$ is outside of $Q$''. Specifically, we need to find those segments where $\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)} \leq 1 - \rho$. By similarity of triangles, 
\[ 
\frac{d(p, p')}{d(p, o)} = \frac{d(p, p')}{L} = \frac{d(u, u')}{d(u, o)} = \frac{2 d(u, u')}{2 d(u, o)} = \frac{2(\alpha - a)}{c - a}
\]

\noindent and 
\[ 
\frac{d(q, q')}{d(q, o)} = \frac{d(q, q')}{L} = \frac{d(v, v')}{d(v, o)} = \frac{2 d(v, v')}{2 d(v, o)} = \frac{2(c - \gamma)}{c - a}
\]

\noindent Thus,
\[
\begin{split} 
\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)}
%
&= \frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{2L} \\
%
&= \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{d(p, p')}{L} + \frac{d(q, q')}{L} \right ) \\
%
&= \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{2(\alpha - a)}{c - a} + \frac{2(c - \gamma)}{c - a} \right ) \\
%
&= \frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} \\
%
&= \frac{\alpha - a + c - \gamma}{c - a} \\
%
&= 1 + \frac{\alpha - \gamma}{c - a} \\
%
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, the inequality $\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)} \leq 1 - \rho$ can instead be evaluated as $1 + \frac{\alpha - \gamma}{c - a} \leq 1 - \rho$, which is based on two query variables $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.  We can further simplify the expression to
\[ 
\rho(c - a) \leq \gamma - \alpha
\]

\noindent where the value of $\gamma - \alpha$ is a single variable calculated at query time.  This inequality can therefore be checked by an orthogonal range search similar to the techniques used in Section~\ref{:rectangles:ap:approach}.

When $o \not \in Q$, we cannot construct similar triangles in the same way, since we require the points of intersection between the triangles and $Q$.  However, since we know that any segment which \emph{is} majority enclosed by $Q$ will have its centre point in $Q$, it is sufficient for our purposes if our test condition always reports a failure when $o$ is outside of $Q$.

We know that both $p$ and $q$ are outside of $Q$, so it must be the case that $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} > 0$ and $\frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} > 0$. Observe that if $o$ is left of $\alpha$, then $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} > 1/2$. Likewise, if $o$ is right of $\gamma$, then $\frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} > 1/2$. Therefore, the sum $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} > 1/2$ and is strictly larger than any allowable value for $(1 - \rho)$, resulting in the segment being rejected as desired.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Class (ii); e.g., $(p, q) \in (I, III)$}
\label{:rectanges:ao:class2}

Class (ii) is concerned with segments which cross perpendicular sides of $Q$. We present the details of the majority property for the case where $p \in I$ and $q \in III$; the solutions for other cases of class (ii) are similar. These expressions are not so different from the ones given in class (i), however we will see that we get two independent variables instead of one, and this has ramifications for how we will construct our query data structure later.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/fig_ao_case2}
  \caption[An example of a segment in class (ii), case $(I, III)$.]{An example of a segment in class (ii), case $(I, III)$. This particular segment is not majority enclosed by $Q$ for any allowable value of $\rho$.}
  \label{fig:rectangles:ao:case2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Assume for now that $o \in Q$ and let $p'$ ($q'$) be the intersection of $s$ with $Q$ closest to $p$ ($q$).  Let $u = (a, f)$ be the point under $p$ directly left of $o$. Then, $\Delta p u o$ is a right triangle, and $u' = (\alpha, f)$ is the intersection point of $\overline{u o}$ with the boundary of $Q$.  The triangle $\Delta p' u' o$ is right triangle and is similar to $\Delta p u o$. Likewise, let $v = (e, d)$ be the point left of $q$ directly under $o$. Then, $\Delta q v o$ is a right triangle, and $v' = (e, \beta)$ is the intersection point of $\overline{v o}$ with the boundary of $Q$. The triangle $\Delta q' v' o$ is right triangle and is similar to $\Delta q v o$. See Figure~\ref{fig:rectangles:ao:case2}.

We need to find those segments where $\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)} \leq 1 - \rho$. By similarity of triangles, 
\[ 
\frac{d(p, p')}{d(p, o)} = \frac{d(p, p')}{L} = \frac{d(u, u')}{d(u, o)} =  \frac{2 d(u, u')}{2 d(u, o)} = \frac{2(\alpha - a)}{c - a}
\]

\noindent and 
\[ 
\frac{d(q, q')}{d(q, o)} = \frac{d(q, q')}{L} = \frac{d(v, v')}{d(v, o)} = \frac{2 d(v, v')}{2 d(v, o)} = \frac{2(\beta - d)}{b - d}
\]

\noindent Thus,
\[
\begin{split} 
\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)}
%
&= \frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{2L} \\
%
&= \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{d(p, p')}{L} + \frac{d(q, q')}{L} \right ) \\
%
&= \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{2(\alpha - a)}{c - a} + \frac{2(\beta - d)}{b - d} \right ) \\
%
&= \frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{\beta - d}{b - d} \\
%
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, the inequality $\frac{d(p, p') + d(q, q')}{d(p, q)} \leq 1 - \rho$ can be tested by checking the equivalent inequality $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{\beta - d}{b - d} \leq 1 - \rho$, defined on the two query variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We will perform this test using a half-plane range query. To construct an appropriate dual-space for the half-plane query, we reorder the expression as follows:
\[
\begin{split}
\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{\beta - d}{b - d} &\leq 1 - \rho \\
%
\frac{\alpha}{c-a} - \frac{a}{c-a} + \frac{\beta}{b-d} - \frac{d}{b-d} &\leq 1 - \rho \\
%
\alpha \cdot \frac{1}{c-a} + \beta \cdot \frac{1}{b-d} &\leq (1 - \rho) + \frac{a}{c-a} + \frac{d}{b-d} \\
%
\alpha + \beta \cdot \frac{c-a}{b-d} &\leq \left ( (1 - \rho) + \frac{d}{b-d} \right ) \cdot (c-a) + a \\
%
\end{split}
\]

\noindent We then map each segment $s$ to a point with coordinates
\[
\left (\frac{c-a}{b-d}, \left ( (1 - \rho) + \frac{d}{b-d} \right ) \cdot (c-a) + a \right )
\]

\noindent In this space, segments matching the majority expression correspond to dual-points satisfying the following half-plane.
\[
y \geq \beta \cdot x + \alpha
\]

Just as in class (i), when $o \not \in Q$, we cannot construct appropriate similar triangles for our method, but it remains sufficient for the expressions to reject any such segment. Observe that if $o$ is left of $\alpha$, then $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} > 1/2$. Likewise, if $o$ is below $\beta$, then $\frac{\beta - d}{b - d} > 1/2$. Their sum is therefore strictly greater than $1/2$, and larger than any allowable value for $(1 - \rho)$, rejecting the segment as desired.

\subsubsection{Class (iii); e.g., $(p, q) \in (I, IV)$}
\label{:rectanges:ao:class3}

Class (iii) is concerned with segments which have one endpoint in a corner region of $Q$, and the other endpoint in an orthogonal region of $Q$. We present the details of the majority property for the case where $p \in I$ and $q \in IV$; the solutions for other variations of Class (iii) are similar.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}

  \label{fig:rectangles:ao:case3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Assume for now that $o \in Q$. We need to consider two subcases: (a) $s$ crosses $\alpha$ and $\beta$ or (b) $s$ crosses $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. See Figure~\ref{fig:rectangles:ao:case3} for examples. Subcase (a) is very nearly exactly the example presented for class (ii). In that case, the only use of the fact that the endpoints of $s$ were located in regions $I$ and $III$ was to imply that $s$ crossed $\alpha$ and $\beta$. As such, this subcase can use the same expression for testing $s$. Likewise, subcase (b) is similar to the example presented for class (i) and can use exactly that expression for testing $s$.

Our initial query for identifying the regions of $p$ and $q$ does not allow us to differentiate between subcases. However, it is sufficient to check both subcases simultaneously.

From class (i) and class (ii), we have the following expressions:
\[ 
\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} \leq 1 - \rho
\]

\noindent and
\[ 
\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{\beta - d}{b - d} \leq 1 - \rho
\]

If $s$ belongs to subcase (a), then $\frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} \leq \frac{\beta - d}{b - d}$ since $\gamma$ is farther right than the point where $s$ exits $Q$. Likewise, in subcase (b), $\frac{\beta - d}{b - d} \leq \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a}$.  Therefore, in either subcase, the result of the correct expression is larger than the incorrect one, allowing us to correctly reject segments by blindly checking both conditions.  This also holds when $o \not \in Q$, since the expression for at least one subcase would exclude the segment.


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Class (iv); e.g., $(p, q) \in (II, VI)$}
\label{:rectanges:ao:class4}

Class (iv) is concerned with segments whose endpoints appear in diagonally opposite corner regions of $Q$. We present the details of the majority property for the case where $p \in II$ and $q \in VI$; the solution for the $(VI, VIII)$ case is similar.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/fig_ao_case4a}
  \hspace{1.0em}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/fig_ao_case4b}

  \label{fig:rectangles:ao:case4}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Assume for now that $o \in Q$. As with class (iii), we need to consider several subcases depending on which sides of $Q$ are intersected by $s$:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $s$ crosses $\alpha$ and $\delta$,
\item $s$ crosses $\alpha$ and $\gamma$,
\item $s$ crosses $\beta$ and $\delta$,
\item $s$ crosses $\beta$ and $\gamma$,
\end{enumerate}

See Figure~\ref{fig:rectangles:ao:case4} for examples of each subcase. Our initial query for identifying the regions of $p$ and $q$ does not allow us to differentiate between subcases. However, it is sufficient to check all subcases simultaneously. The expression for subcase (b) comes directly from class (i).  Using similar techniques as we did in class (i) and class (ii), we develop the following set of expressions:

\begin{align*}
& (a) \quad \frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{d - \delta}{d - b} \leq 1 - \rho
& (b) \quad \frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} + \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} \leq 1 - \rho \\
& (c) \quad \frac{\beta  - b}{d - b} + \frac{d - \delta}{d - b} \leq 1 - \rho  
& (d) \quad \frac{\beta  - b}{d - b} + \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a} \leq 1 - \rho \\
\end{align*}

Subcases (b) and (c) can be simplified to orthogonal range queries, while subcases (a) and (d) will need to be mapped to appropriate half-plane queries as we saw in class (ii).

To illustrate that checking all four conditions simultaneously yields correct results, consider what happens if $s$ belongs to subcase (a), where $s$ crosses $\alpha$ and $\delta$. In these circumstances, $u'$ is above $\beta$, and we have that $\frac{\alpha - a}{c - a} \geq \frac{\beta - b}{d - b}$.  Likewise, $v'$ is left of $\gamma$, so $\frac{d - \delta}{d - b} \geq \frac{c - \gamma}{c - a}$.  Therefore, the expression for (a) dominates the other expressions (i.e., $\text{(a)} \geq \text{(b)}$, $\text{(a)} \geq \text{(c)}$, and $\text{(a)} \geq \text{(d)}$), allowing us to identify qualifying segments for subcase (a) by blindly checking all conditions. This property is true for segments belonging to subcases (b), (c), and (d) as well. Furthermore, this test also holds when $o \not \in Q$, since the expression for at least one subcase would exclude the segment.

\subsection{Construction and Analysis}
\label{:rectangles:ao:analysis}

The method we have developed above takes a very case-by-case approach to solving the problem. There are two overall phases to the steps above. The first phase must identify segments falling into each of the 16 cases outlined above. For each case, the second phase must then identify those segments satisfying their respective majority property. 

Broadly, our solution to this problem uses a multi-level range tree (Section~\ref{:prelim:range-trees}) for the classification phase, and a combination of range trees and canonical subsets structures (Section~\ref{:prelim:chan}) to check the majority expressions. 

Identifying the segments which satisfy each case of each class is a matter of testing a set of several conditions, all of which must be true. The order that we test the conditions in makes no difference to the correctness of the algorithm, but can have an impact on its space requirements.

\paragraph{Class (i), $(p, q) \in (I, V)$ case.} 
To identify these segments, we need to find those segments whose endpoints are in the appropriate regions, and which satisfy the single, orthogonal majority expression for the case. 
Using an approach similar to Section~\ref{:rectangle:ap:analysis}, for each $s_i \in S$, we construct a corresponding 5D point $v_i$ as follows.
\[
v_i = (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i, \rho(c_i - a_i))
\]

\noindent We then query these points with the 5D box:
\[
(-\infty, \alpha) \times [\beta, \delta] \times (\gamma, \infty) \times [\beta, \delta] \times (-\infty, \gamma - \alpha]
\]

\noindent The following lemma summarizes how we can query this class of segments.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class1:v}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments belonging to class (i) \emph{and} which satisfy their majority property in $\BigOh{\log^4{n}}$ time using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^4{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}

\paragraph{Class (ii), $(p, q) \in (I, III)$ case.} 
As with all cases, part of the problem involves first identifying those segments with endpoints in the appropriate regions.
In this case, however, the majority expression is evaluated using a half-plane query.

The classification portion is performed just as we have seen above. We map each segment to the 4D point $v_i = ( a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i )$. The majority expression will be queried by the dual-space we developed in Section~\ref{:rectanges:ao:class2}. For each $s_i \in S$, we define $h_i = \left ( \frac{c - a}{b - d}, \left ( (1 - \rho) + \frac{d}{b-d} \right ) \cdot (c-a) + a \right )$.  We will combine these two points into query object pairs $q_i = (v_i, h_i)$.

By Theorem~\ref{th:rangetree}, we can query the classification component using a range tree according to the following lemma.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class2:v}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments belonging to class (ii) in $\BigOh{\log^3{n}}$ time using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^3{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}

By Theorem~\ref{th:chan}, we can query the half-plane component of our query objects using a canonical subsets data structure, giving the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class2:h}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments satisfying a half-plane representation of a majority expression in $\BigOh{\sqrt{n}\log{n}}$ time, using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}

Since the order that we check our conditions in does not affect correctness, we will check the half-plane condition first, then the endpoint classification.  
By Corollary~\ref{cor:multichan}, we can accomplish this by associating a classification structure with each subset of the half-plane structure. The resulting structure is summarized by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class2:c}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments belonging to class (ii) \emph{and} which satisfy their majority property in $\BigOh{\sqrt{n}\log^4{n}}$ time using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^4{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}


\paragraph{Class (iii); $(p, q) \in (I, IV)$ case.} 
This case can use the same orthogonal structure that we developed in Lemma~\ref{lem:ao:class1:v} and the same half-plane expression as in Lemma~\ref{lem:ao:class2:h}. 
One component of the query box needs to be updated to account for region IV as follows.
\[
(-\infty, \alpha) \times [\beta, \delta] \times (\gamma, \infty) \times (-\infty, \beta) \times (-\infty, \gamma - \alpha]
\]

By Corollary~\ref{cor:multichan}, we can combine these two data structures to create a new structure which can answer this case as summarized by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class3:c}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments belonging to class (iii) \emph{and} which satisfy their majority property in $\BigOh{\sqrt{n}\log^5{n}}$ time using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^5{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}


\paragraph{Class (iv); $(p, q) \in (II, VI)$ case.} 
This case has the largest number of majority expressions which need checking, in addition to the usual endpoint classification step. As a result, it will take the largest data structure to query.

The basic steps are just as in the last three cases. To cover endpoint classification and the two orthogonal majority expressions, we will use a data structure and query box similar to Lemma~\ref{lem:ao:class1:v}, but extended to 6D to cover the extra majority expression.  We then apply Lemma~\ref{lem:ao:class2:h} and Corollary~\ref{cor:multichan} twice to handle the two half-plane majority expressions. The entire structure for this case is summarized by the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:ao:class4:c}
Given a set of $n$ line segments, we can identify segments belonging to class (iv) \emph{and} which satisfy their majority property in $\BigOh{\sqrt{n}\log^7{n}}$ time using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^7{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{lemma}


\paragraph{Combining the Steps.} 

Querying the entire environment requires us to create data structures for handling when one or both endpoints of a line segment lie entirely inside a query $Q$, as well as the structures for each of the cases when both endpoints lie outside of $Q$. Overall, this process is dominated by the structure required for the class (iv) segments. The following theorem summarizes the overall solution.

\begin{theorem}
\label{th:ao}
Given a set of $n$ arbitrarily-oriented line segments, we can identify all segments which satisfy the majority property for a given query rectangle in $\BigOh{\sqrt{n}\log^7{n}}$ time, using a data structure requiring $\BigOh{n\log^7{n}}$ preprocessing time and space.
\end{theorem}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{:rectangles:concl}

In this chapter, we have developed methods for answering the majority range query problem on both axis-parallel and arbitrarily oriented line segments with axis-parallel query regions. 
We have seen that the most challenging cases occur when both endpoints of a segment exist outside of the query region, but the segment nevertheless satisfies the majority property.  
We have also seen how we can transform majority expressions into dual spaces which can be easily queried with a half-plane.

There are several possibilities for future work.
Most notably is the condition that $\rho > 1/2$ for the arbitrary-orientation problem, which we will see is the only problem with such a limitation over all of the problems covered in this thesis.
The limitation stems from our use of similar triangles anchored on the centrepoint of the segment.
When $\rho > 1/2$, the centrepoint of any segment satisfying the majority property will be found inside the query region, guaranteeing intersections between $Q$ and our similar triangles.

We would also like to reduce how many simultaneous majority expressions need to be checked. Having to check multiple expressions is a direct result of the uncertainty of which boundary of $Q$ a segment intersects. If we could directly identify the intersected boundaries with a better classification strategy, the number of nested levels required by our data structures could be reduced.

Finally, with the axis-parallel case, we are able to save a constant factor of space by sharing the classification steps between queries. 
In the arbitrary-orientation case, we perform our half-plane queries first as this saves us a $\log{n}$ factor in our asymptotic preprocessing needs, but which prevents us from sharing the endpoint classification structures which are common to all cases.  
Some experimentation is needed to identify for which inputs this trade-off makes practical sense.
